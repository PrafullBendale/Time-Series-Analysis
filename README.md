# Time-Series-Analysis

In this project i had a problem statement as mentioned below and the dataset file.

Problem Statement:-YouTube is losing its advertise revenue because of flat pricing. YouTube have decided to set the ad rates depending upon ads being watched in that hour. More the viewer, higher should be the prices.
In order to achieve this mechanism, YouTube is trying to identify the pattern in ad viewership. Company wish to see if they can predict the ads as per the hours of the day. As a data scientist, please help the company to identify the ad traffic by hour and to predict it.

I have used Python for the data processing and visualization. Along with Python i used Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib libraries for Data Preprocessing, Model Training And Data Visualization.
